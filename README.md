# Kmeans
K-means algorithm is one of most easy and yet powerful ways to work with unsupervised data. It depends on clustering the closer point and dividing them into k groups and returning k centroids.
The algorithm operates in the following steps:

Specify K number of clusters
K data points are randomly selected for the centroids (data points representing the cluster centers)
Each sample is assigned to its nearest centroid
New centroids are created by taking the mean value of all of
the samples assigned to each previous centroid

Calculate the difference between the old and new centroid
Repeat until the centroids do not change significantly
